# Notes

During this work I used Windscribe which I use on daily basis mostly as a smart autocomplete. I haven't used it for scaffolding the app.

The app controlled by two states in the root component (App). In real life case i'd prefer to use some state manager because structure of the components wouldn't be so simple. For test task purpose it's enough.

UI is very basic but support dark/light theme and has a mobile version.
